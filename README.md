# Artificial-Neural-Networks

- Implemented a HW/SW co-design project by training an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) on the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras in Python, achieving a 93% accuracy
- Used Vitis HLS for high-level synthesis to generate Verilog code, integrated with Quartus Prime for FPGA synthesis, and mapped pins to FPGA-HPS Avalon bridge using Qsys
- Developed embedded C code on the HPS for FPGA-accelerated digit prediction, sending MNIST inputs through the Avalon bridge and receiving the predicted result
